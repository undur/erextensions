Framework Description
-----------------------

ERCoolComponents is a collection of useful extensions components that require
Ajax framework.

"The intent was that Ajax framework would be the base building blocks for Ajax things, 
ERX would be the base building blocks for non-Ajax things, but we didn't have a place 
to put useful generic components that were more like ERX, but need Ajax. so ERCoolComponents is a 
framework for putting components that we don't want to pollute Ajax framework with."
